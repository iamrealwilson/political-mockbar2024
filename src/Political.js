In  keeping with   the   modern  age   of instant  and   incessant  information  and  transformation, Congress passed Cybercrime Prevention Act to regulate access to and use  of the  amenities of the cyberspace.

    "text": "14.  A terrorist group  called  the Emerald Brigade  is based  in the State of Asyaland.  The  government of Asyaland  does  not support  the terrorist group,  but being a poor country, is powerless to stop it. The  Emerald   Brigade   launched  an  attack  on  the  Philippines,  firing  two  missiles  that  killed thousands of Filipinos.  It then warned  that more  attacks  were  forthcoming. Through  diplomatic channels, the Philippines demanded that Asyaland  stop the Emerald Brigade; otherwise, it will do whatever  is necessary to defend itself. Receiving reliable intelligence reports of another imminent attack by the Emerald  Brigade,  and it appearing that Asyaland  was  incapable of preventing the assault,  the Philippines sent a crack commando team to Asyaland.  The  team stayed  only for a few hours  in Asyaland,   succeeded in  killing  the  leaders  and  most  of the  members of the  Emerald Brigade,  then immediately returned to the Philippines. (A)  Was  the  Philippine  action  justified  under  the  international law  principle   of self-defense? Explain your answer.  (2009 Bar Question)   "
